# What is Coding? | Quiz (づ╥﹏╥)づ

## Time to Play
When the user has read the instructions and is ready to get started, they can begin the quiz by clicking the 'Play' button. By doing so, the Quiz page will be displayed and a timer(with a duration of 60 sconds) will be initiated.

## Handling Correct/Incorrect Choices
After the user has determined which choice that they would like to choose for their answer, they can then click one of the choices(A, B, C, or D). The quiz will then determine whether their choice is equal to the answer for the current question(the question will blink green if correct and blink red if incorrect) while also generating the next available question.

## Submit Your Highscore
Once the user has completed all the questions to the quiz(or the timer has reached a duration of 0), they will be navigated to the Summary page where their final score will be displayed. The user will then be given the option to enter their name in order to submit their Highscore to the Leaderboard.

## Leaderboard
The Leaderboard page will display all of the user's past quiz scores(that were submitted and saved to local storage). Additionally, each entry will have a random color upon every page load to add a fun visual aesthetic.
